### Q2 2026 — Content
- [ ] **Blog with Comments** — Allow signed-in visitors to leave comments *(Apr 2026)*
- [ ] **Private Projects** — Gate certain projects (NDA work) behind authentication *(May 2026)*

### Q3 2026 — Engagement
- [ ] **Guestbook** — A signed guestbook where visitors can leave messages *(Jul 2026)*
- [ ] **Save Favorites** — Let visitors bookmark projects *(Aug 2026)*

### Q4 2026 — Nice to Have
