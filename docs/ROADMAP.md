## 🔐 Authentication Feature Ideas

The portfolio currently has Google OAuth via Supabase. Here are potential ways to leverage it:

### High Priority
- [ ] **CMS Dashboard** — Add/edit/delete projects directly from the dashboard without touching code
- [ ] **Restrict login to owner only** — Limit sign-in to your email address so only you can access the dashboard

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Private Projects** — Gate certain projects (NDA work, client projects) behind authentication
- [ ] **Blog with Comments** — Allow signed-in visitors to leave comments on blog posts

### Nice to Have
- [ ] **Guestbook** — A signed guestbook where visitors can leave messages
- [ ] **Save Favorites** — Let visitors bookmark projects and come back later
- [ ] **Newsletter Signup** — Collect emails for project update notifications

### Consider Removing Auth If:
- You decide to keep the portfolio as a simple static showcase
- You prefer managing content through code/Git instead of a dashboard
